          <h3><b>About Myself</b></h3>

          <p2>My Name is Hardik Singh, I pursued my Bachelor's in Engineering degree from Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology from the department of Electronics and Communication.I am a very Happy and Dun loving guy.I am also a Machine Learning enthusiast focusing mainly on Deep Learning and Machine Learning Algorithms. I quite like the concept of Neural networks. Recently I became interested in Artificial Intelligence, mainly the Reinforcement Learning.</p2>


          <p2 class="gap_between">I like working on real life datsets and creating new models based on Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence. I have also worked with people in different universities collaborating on real life data to perform feature extraction, preprocessing, data modelling and finding insights.</p2>



          <h4><b>Research Interest</b></h4>

          <p2>I am very curious about new technologies that are escalting in the data world and my main research interests include Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence and Data Visualization. I feel happy in building Models with the new data. I worked with Two Researchers at University of Coimbra in Machine Learning and visualizing the data for 6 months in order to prevent road accidents.</p2>
